# PIPO STANDALONE - By Quazar


A Standalone pipeline manager for Autodesk Maya that include
features of project customization:

(Features to come)
- 3D Scenes filenames
- Folder structures
- Exporting process
- Shading networking

and also others features as:

- Detect performances knobs in Pipeline and give solutions scripts to fix them
- Creation of asset library on the computer through projects (even old projects)
- Real time monitoring of the project you are working on
- Share assets between projects you worked on before


> [!IMPORTANT]
> To create the visual side of that application I am using a library
called [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), which will allow you to merge the flexibility that a Console can
give you, while using the same widgets you are used to.
